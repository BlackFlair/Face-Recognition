# Face-Recognition

GENERAL:
- Uses deep learning model in face-train.py to train.
  Note: This is not a ideal way.
  
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create a directory named "images" in ..\FaceRecognition
- ..\FaceRecognition\images should have one or more directories with name of the Person Of Interest.
- This does not contain a Haar Cascade Classifier. 
  User must use their own cascade. 
  The absolute file path of the classifier is to be added in both main-face-recognize.py (Line 5) and face-train.py (Line 10) files.
- First run face-train.py and let the model train.
  Then run main-face-recognize.py to open camera and perform recognition.
